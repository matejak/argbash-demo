# argbash-demo

## Getting Argbash

To get argbash, you can:

* Install it using your package manager on `Fedora`, `Archlinux`, or EPEL.

* Use the `get-argbash` script, which will download and unpack a release.
  Then, call the `argbash` executable script by specifying `argbash-<version goes here>/bin/argbash`

* Use `argbash-docker` as the argbash executable script. It will download images ~ 30 MB when called for the first time.

* Visit https://argbash.io/generate to use the online generator.

Once you have Argbash, visit directories with exercises, and follow the instructions.
